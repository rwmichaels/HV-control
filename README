HV software for rpi boards

Below is information from Roman, who started this.
However, this is just the minimal version, it has
tcp_test and scripts directory.
It is assumed that you already have Perl, Expect, etc.
If not, you'll need to get those.

List of installed packages for running of HV PERL Shim Server on Raspberry Pi board.
Packages to install in directory:
pkg_to_install/

PERL:
 1. IO-Multiplex-1.13.tar.gz 
 2. Net-Server-2.007.tar.gz
 3. IO-Tty-1.10.tar.gz
 4. Expect-1.21.tar.gz

 Commands to install:
  tar xvfz *.tar.gz
  cd <to_package_dir>
  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  sudo make install

(optional)
For gcc compiler (need to compile old 'i2lchv_linux_NNNN.c' with terminal interface);
 5. readline-6.3
 6. ncurses-5.9

 Commands to install:
  tar xvfz *.tar.gz
  cd <to_package_dir>
  configure		
  make
  sudo make install

(optional)
For system telnet client:
 7. telnet_0.17-36_armhf.deb
 Commands to install:
 sudo dpkg -i telnet_0.17-36_armhf.deb

JAVA (optional: to run Java HV GUI on this board)
(http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-arm-downloads-2187472.html)
(http://www.raspihub.com/go/852f2b489f65630418c7c97b5dd64ee9f8b85ba8c0e6b6ba3a579d9902eb064d):
 1. Create a new directory where we will install the JDK files to: 
  sudo mkdir -p -v /opt/java
 2. Unpack the Oracle JDK .gz file using this command:
  sudo tar xvzf jdk-8-linux-arm-vfp-hflt.tar.gz -C /opt/java
 3. We need to let the system know there is a new JVM installed and where it is located: 
  sudo update-alternatives --install "/usr/bin/java" "java" "/opt/java/jdk1.8.0/bin/java" 1
  sudo update-alternatives --set java /opt/java/jdk1.8.0/bin/java

Configure date/time client to synchronize local date/time from network time server (ntp)
1. On server add next line to '/etc/ntp/config' file:
     restrict 192.168.2.0 mask 255.255.255.0 nomodify notrap
 Restart ntpd service:
     /sbin/service ntpd restart
2. On this board add next line to '/etc/ntp/config' file:
     server 192.168.2.1
 Reboot Raspberry Pi board:
     sudo shutdown -r now
	
HV1458 server (for TCP or telnet connections uses port=24742):
COMPILE source code:
 gcc 20140618_i2lchv_rPI-linux.c -o 20140618_i2lchv_rPI-linux

START '20140618_i2lchv_rPI-linux' program (HV1458 server):
 sudo ./20140618_i2lchv_rPI-linux

PERL Shim server (for TCP or telnet connections uses port=2001):
START Perl Shim Server (with TCP/IP connection to HV1458 server and telnet connection to Java GUI):
 cd tcp_test
 sudo ./LecroyHV_Shim_telnet

OR

START Perl Shim Server (with TCP/IP connection to HV1458 server and TCP/IP connection to Java GUI):
 cd tcp_test
 sudo ./LecroyHV_Shim_tcp


TODO
1. Start/configure time client to synchronize local date/time from network time server.
2. Change username/password for HV.
3. There is HiPi Perl modules (http://raspberry.znix.com/) to control Raspberry GPIO pins.
   May be someone can transform 'i2lchv_linux_NNNN.c' code to PERL and insert it to Shim Server.
